FINDINGS.pdf – A compiled report with screenshots of all the visualizations and detailed written observations. It also includes a summary of key findings.

Objective:

To explore and analyze the Titanic dataset in order to identify patterns related to passenger survival. The analysis focuses on attributes such as gender, passenger class, age, and fare.

Summary of Findings:

Females and 1st class passengers had significantly higher survival rates.

Most male and 3rd class passengers did not survive.

Younger passengers, especially children, had slightly better survival odds.

Higher fares, often associated with 1st class, correlated with higher survival.
